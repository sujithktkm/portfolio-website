        <h1>Welcome to my profile website</h1>
        <p>I worked as a Software Engineering intern in Clari, where I was responsible for developing a UI used to generate reports, working on API documentation, creating new API endpoints, integrating tools, streamlining hotfix process and automating excel operations and simplify processing of excel sheets. Most of the coding was in JAVA and Python but some projects required learning new languages like Google apps script, Scala, Coffescript, Angular JS which I managed to do and deliver the outcomes in given time constraints. This experience helped me learn server-side scripting, front-end and back-end coding, writing unit tests, logging, API related work, version control using Git and working with AWS.</p>

        <p>I also worked as a Technology intern in S and P Capital IQ. During my tenure, I developed a tool which was deployed on company platform and helped Quality Analysts of 5 different teams efficiently test performance of various SQL objects. This project helped me gain experience in agile development and methodologies, C#, writing complex procedures and queries, pushing code to production and software development life cycle. This experience helped me learn back-end coding and connectivity, automated testing, writing unit tests and tool development.</p>

        <p>During my undergraduate studies, I was Vice President at a start-up (team of 6) which concentrates on providing practice to student on interviews and coding challenges. My role was to guide the engineering team in developing website and help in product development. I coordinated 7 different national events including technical events, coding challenges and project presentations. One of my interests include volunteering regularly at orphanages in city.</p>

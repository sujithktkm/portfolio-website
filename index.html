        <h1>Welcome to my profile website</h1>
        <p>I am Sujith Katakam, Graduate student in Department of Computer Science (CSC) at North Carolina State University. I have an experience of 18 months working as an Technology Intern in S&P Capital IQ (6 months), as a Software Engineer Intern in Clari (3 months) and as a volunteer for a startup in India (6 months). Currently I am working in Citrix Systems as a Software Engineering Intern (co-op, 3 months till date).</p>

        <u><h2>My Work Experience</h2></u>

        <h3>Software Engineering Intern in Citrix Systems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>I am working on building scripts to automate manual tasks and manage the servers and maintain configurations. I also extended the usefulness of public facing RESTful APIs to develop useful applications that visualize data, extend the functionality of the service beyond what is available in the standard management console. One other project I am working on is to add authentication and create widgets on dashboard (internal) using C# on backend, HTML, CSS and JavaScript on frontend.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Software Engineering Intern in Clari</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>I was responsible for developing a UI used to generate reports, working on API documentation, creating new API endpoints, integrating tools, streamlining hotfix process and automating excel operations and simplify processing of excel sheets. Most of the coding was in JAVA and Python but some projects required learning new languages like Google apps script, Scala, Coffescript, Angular JS which I managed to do and deliver the outcomes in given time constraints. This experience helped me learn server-side scripting, front-end and back-end coding, writing unit tests, logging, API related work, version control using Git and working with AWS.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technology intern in S&P Capital IQ</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>During my tenure, I developed an application which was deployed on company platform and helped Quality Analysts of 5 different teams to efficiently test the performance of various SQL objects. This project helped me gain experience in Agile development and methodologies, C# coding, writing complex procedures and SQL queries, handling code push (to production) and software development life cycle. This experience helped me learn back-end coding and connectivity, automated testing, writing unit tests and application development.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

                <h3>1. Framework to test Performance of SQL Objects</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Developed a tool which can evaluate the performance of SQL objects at both object level and query level. Designed a decent UI and graphical representations to display the statistics, queries, execution plans. Also determined the threshold of an object in multi-threaded programming by virtual load generation.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Test Harness to Validate Web Services</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Implemented a test harness framework that enables the retrieval of the web service inner methods and allows the scheduling of periodic tests to monitor the health of web services. Logged all the saved schedules and test results to identify critical areas and proactively act before the downtime impact of the web service is felt.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. Web-based tool for accelerated learning and evaluation</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Designed a website with a sophisticated back-end database which is a point of communication for students and respective professors to carry course related work, post homework, grades and announcements.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Stage Pipeline, DevOps</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Implemented build pipeline using Jenkins, added Git hook considering load balancing to make sure the requests are distributed among all the servers efficiently. In test pipeline we improved code coverage, identified which branches are covered and also obtained bug reports. In the deployment pipeline, we used ansible and vagrant to deploy an application on real remote machine (AWS ec2 instances), performed canary release and performed monitoring of application after canary release. In the final pipeline we poerformed resilience testing using our own versions of Chaos Monkey and Doctor Monkey.</p>

                <h3>5. Point of Sales System</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Programmed an interactive system which uses monitor to add or delete purchases, a bar code scanner to detect the product, its quantity, price and benefits, if any and a receipt generator that summarize the purchases.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. Online Tour Guide</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>This project helps the tour planners to ease their work. They can work online and using their own website allow people to check all different packages they provide and also it helps the users to check the tour plan and have a look at all the places they might visit in the tour. It also involves registrations which help them get some possible deals.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>7. Simpledb</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Developed a clock replacement policy in buffer management. Reduced time taken to find a buffer for replacement using hash maps. Stabilized the data storage against system crashes and power losses.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>8. Study of User Migration and analysis of response time on Stack Overflow data set</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Analyzed migration of developers in iOS and Android over the past 6 years based on questions and answers posted on Stack Overflow. Evaluated the effect on response time based on various factors related to <strong>tags</strong> on the question.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>9. Data deduplication across Distributed Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Implemented deduplication for efficient data storage. Used distributed storage to store data between more than one nodes to improve read speeds, upto 4X.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <h3>10. Cryptographic analysis and Implementation of Statistical Key Recovery Attack on WEP</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Analyzed various ways possible to crack WEP and implemented a statistical attack (FMS attack) to recover the "key" from a log of WEP packets. Also presented a research paper, which explains different vulnerabilities in WEP protocol and ways to improve the same. However, few of these vulnerabilities were addressed in later standards such as WPA and WPA2.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <h3>11. Secure Email System</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Implemented a secure email system that can send an encrypted email and decrypt any valid secure email received, using both symmetric-key and public-key cryptography techniques. Used a Network Security concept called Certification Authorities to validate receiver's certificate (while sending email) and sender's certificate (while receiving email) and a local database-utility to track certificates of all users in the system.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>12. Technical Security Review of OpenMRS</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Performed a security review of an open-source, electronic health care system called OpenMRS to identify security flaws in the system. To achieve this, OpenMRS was tested against various vulnerabilities listed in OWASP Top 10 and SANS 25. We also performed a static analysis of source code and threat modeling for certain workflows in OpenMRS. To finish the review, we analyzed usability of OpenMRS against Jakob Nielson’s usability heuristics and documented the steps required to mitigate discovered threats.</p>

            <li>
              <p>•Scrutinized an open-source dynamic analysis tool, called Omen+ which detects deadlocks in multithread Java libraries.
•Created a compatible virtual machine environment to exhibit the functionality of the tool.
•Automated the deployment of the virtual machine through scripting based on Vagrant and Docker.
•Built a GitHub repository for the automation script which substantially reduced manual work in VM creation.</p>
